This lesson was demonstrated for the Deep Sea Data Squad at UBC in Novemeber of 2019. As such, the code is not a formal lesson but shows how to do some common tasks in RMarkdown. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# install.packages("rmarkdown")
# install.packages("knitr")
# install.packages("bookdown")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(bookdown)
# #library(knitr)


```

# Read in data
(Headings come in different levels (#, ##, ###, ####))
Our data is from...


## Data Sources
Data is fun. 

### Data sources really detailed 
We got out data from Fishbase [@Froese2012], through the RFishbase package [@Boettiger2012]. 

```{r data}
df <- tibble(x=rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1))
```

# Analysis

There is a non-linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.
$$ y = x^2 $$
When 

$log(y_{it}) = \alpha Fish_{it} + \beta Length_{it} + \gamma_{i} + \Delta_{t} + \epsilon_{it}$ (1)   


$\delta_{time}$ (2)

$$\sum \alpha \varepsilon$$ (3)

Line breaks need to be explicit ("\<br>"), or with two spaces.

```{r analysis}
df$y <- df$x ^ 2 

x_mean <- mean(df$x)

y_mean <- mean(df$y)

```

# Results 

```{r figure1, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap="This is a plot"}
fig1 <- df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=x)) + 
  geom_histogram()
print(fig1)
```

Our results are clearly shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure1). 

While we *expect* a value of 0 for our mean, our **actual mean** is `r toString(round(x_mean,6))`. Our unrounded mean is `r toString(x_mean)`. 
When we don't use toString, let's see what happens `r x_mean`.

For more details, see Table \@ref(tab:kable-table).

```{r table1, eval=FALSE}
ss_df <- summary(df)
ss_df
```


```{r kable-table}
ss_df <- summary(df)
knitr::kable(ss_df, caption = "Summary statistics of our data")
```
